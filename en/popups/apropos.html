                <h2>Metronome by Lorant Deutsch</h2>
                <p>This Web-documentary is inspired by the documentary ‘’Metronome’’ by Lorànt Deutsch. This documentary concern on various faces of the story of Paris through the different metro stations. It provoked by curiousity of discovering anecdotes and short stories which associated with these stations of Metro Parisian.</p>
                <p>By all these stories, Métronome tells the struggles, hopes, conflicts, structures that provide the secret of Paris, and allows to raise some mysteries. It makes easy to find what we can discover from the past that we believed and hidden forever.</p>
                <p>We took this documentary to make a web documentary. Because we found that it is instructive.</p>
                <p>So, the purpose of this web documentary is to participate in this instruction but in another way while keeping the same idea.</p>
                <p>With a team of 10 people, all of students is in Master 1 at University of Paris 13 - Villetaneuse, it created during the academic year of 2017-2018 in a general core curriculum. Some of us are in Multimedia and Internet Interface Design and others in Innovations in Communication. Together, we gathered our skills to make this web documentary in a trip in Paris by Lorànt Deutsch Métronome.</p>
                <p>As an university project, it was supported by our professorst: Guy BILISKO and Ines LAITANO.</p>
                <h4>“A Curious Journey Through The Metronome”</h4>
                <p>During this journey in Paris, we travel in 4 stations of several railways. We focused on our work on the following stations : Châtelet, Cité, Maubert-Mutualité, and Invalides. Its were chosen because the anecdotes have relation with our web documentary’s vision : the places, historical characters, and the storytelling. It is addressed to people who want to know more about the story of Paris.</p>
                <p>However, it works like an information media, composed of images, sound, and videos which present different stations.</p>
                <p>Concerning to the topic Metronome,  it was chosen from a proposal idea of the topic which came from some members of the group. After the realisation of global vote, Métronome was selected. </p>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to offer a different web documentary especially by the interface and illustrations which tell a story.</p>
