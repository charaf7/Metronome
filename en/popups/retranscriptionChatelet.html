    	<h2>The viking invasion by the river, retaliated on the defensive tower of Châtelet, led by Heude the Count of Paris, which puts an end to the invasion.</h2>
        <p>(drums and flute music) </p>
    <p>Lorant Deutsch: "In the 9th century, the grandsons of Charlemagne divide into three part of large empire. Oriental Franci returns to Louis the germanic. Median Franci to the first Aloter and Western Franci attributed to Charle-le-Chauve. From the Oriental Franci will be born Germany and from Western Franci will be born France. When to Median Franci, it will gain by its two powerful neighbors but Italy will current emerge a bit like it distant heiress. All these divisions excite the appetites of Viking pirates, Normans came from Scandinavia. March 29, 845, Easter day, the dread wins Paris, it is by the river that the Vikings intend to seize the city. And it is not the old ramparts that can prevent the Vikings from invading Paris. For the habitants, it is a defeat, we must take his legs to his neck.”</p>

    <p>Lorant Deutsch: "And everyone takes what he can, a few heads of cattle, jewels, a little flour. And we hasten to go far inland because the Vikings covet their wealth, any provided they report even if they prefer basically that it is hard and stumbling. Gold coins, diamonds, jewelleries, everything is good for them. They don’t want to occupy the land, they don’t seek to impose their power, all they want is to get rich. "</p>

    	<h2>he dark memory of the Place du Chatelet, in the past a jail or cries of slaughtered animals, tortured men and complaints of prisoners resonated.</h2>
         <p>Lorant Deutsh: ''In the beginning of the 9th century, civilizations and empires have forgotten Paris, the city is dying. All the misfortunes of heaven are melting on the edges of the scene: Famine, flood, epidemic; the bread is scarce because of poor harvests, the river is in flood, the island of the city drowns, we can only move by boat and nothing stops the death that lurks inflated bodies, float on the water. We pile on the left bank to stay dry.”</p>
         <p>(music)</p>
<p>Lorant Deutsch : “Châtelet which was initially a tower of defense became over the centuries a sinister prison. There were locked prisoners of common right because the most prestigious went to the Bastille.
    From the revolution, we will be less difficult. All types of prisoners will be welcomed.”</p>
         <p>(road sound effects with vehicle and bike)</p>
<p>Lorant Deutsh :  “In the past, the place was not as wide as it is today. It was steeped and traversed by a maze of narrow, winding streets as dark as they were disturbing.”</p>
         <p>(sound of animal cries)</p>
<p>Lorant Deutsch : “Stretch your ears, the cries of slaughtered animals mingle with the screams of the tortured and the complaints of the prisoners.
It is on this cloaca that extends the terrifying silhouette of the Châtelet.
The place is really one of the most horrible in Paris. Finally the big Châtelet will be demolished in 1804 and we will be careful not to leave anything.
Nothing must remain of a monument of sad memory.
So if one still seeks to imagine what the entrail of the Châtelet looked like, one must cross the stage and pass on the left bank.
Let's go to 42 Rue Galande in the vault of the oubliettes, go down in the cellars and look at the messages of the former tortured, it looks like graffiti, this king hanged in Marmara, here is kept cells and the other dungeon of low pits of the small Châtelet. It is the prison equivalent left bank of the large Châtelet.”</p>

    	<h2>Oppositions between Catholics and Protestants, time of obscurantism and religious intolerance (street murders).</h2>
        <p>(background music)</p>
        <p>Lorant Deutsch : “But in the time of Francis I in the 16th century, if the Renaissance is a flamboyant bouquet of arts and architecture, it is also a time of obscurantism and religious intolerance. On Sunday, August 24, 1572, Saint Bartholomew's day, the kind Protestant men who were the guests of the new King Charles IX were taken to the yard in Louvres. Some escape, and others do not have this chance.”</p>
        <p>(suspense music)</p>
         <p>(Portrait of Charles IX alone, then portrait of Charles IX with Catherine de Médicis)</p>

        <p>Lorant Deutsch : “Charles IX succeeded Francis I and one of his principal advisers is Protestant. At that time the nobility was torn apart, the oppositions between Catholics and Protestants was growing. Catherine de Médicis, the king's mother, is jealous of the influence of the Protestant councilor on her son, she plans his assassination. But the attempt misses.”</p>

        <p>(fighting scene)</p>
        <p>Lorant Deutsch : “Also for fear of reprisals against her, Catherine de Medicis convinced the king to eliminate all Protestants. The Catholic people of Paris are throwing themselves into horror. And everyone massacres his Protestant, every man, woman or child. But how many innocents who found the death for their belief? Estimates are difficult but historians generally agree on the number of 3,000 victims.” </p>

    	<h2>The will of Philippe Auguste to clean up Paris starting with the cemeteries, in particular the cemetery of the innocents where there were pigs and prostitutes.</h2>
        <p>(Music)</p>
<p>Lorant Deutsch : “Let's open the 12th century Philippe Auguste station. Even if it is outside the walls of Paris at that time, this district bears the imprint of that conquering king. There is the avenue to his name, the Bouvine Avenue remember his victory over the germanic Emperor. But especially his statue 4 meters high on one of the throne columns Place of the Nation. Philippe Auguste wants to clean up Paris and the king begins by cleaning the cemetery, strange you say. And know that cemeteries have not always been a haven of peace.” </p>

        <p>(Music with legend): Cemetery of the innocents XIIth century.</p>
        <p>Scene with actors.</p>

<p>Lorant Deutsch : “On the right bank near the halls, the vast cemetery of the innocents open to the four winds offers a desperate image. Between the graves and in front of the open public graveyard, filth accumulates, pigs snort and pretty shameless ladies trade their bodies day and night. The king orders the peripatetic to go exercise their profitable activity somewhere else. The pigs return to the pigsty and the trash is evacuated to protect the place of recollection and the sleep of the dead, it erects a wall that closes the space, from now on, we enter the cemetery only days to pray on a grave or to bury a deceased. At night the doors are closed, everything is under the keys.”

    	<h2>The attempted German invasion against Count Hugues Capet: a singular fight between Yves and the giant</h2>
        <p>(Portrait of the Germanic emperor Otton II) (music action)</p>
    <p>Lorant Deutsch: "Otton II raised an army of 60,000 men including 30,000 horsemen to invade France. In October 978, the German soldiers are ready to besiege Paris and the Count of Paris must defend his city. The germans are already coming, a cloud of dust announces the riders on the heights of Montmartre. However, Otton doesn’t want to measure with Parisian anger, but we must do something. So, to mark the Germanic presence and test the nerves of the Parisians, a soldier who has a strength and a prodigious size is presented every morning in front of the large Châtelet, symbol of the Parisian resistance. He defied the Parisians daily by covering them with insults. "</p>
        <p>(Portrait of Hugues Capet then armor of the knight Yves) </p>

<p>Lorant Deutsch: "For Hugh Capet, this insupportable provocation must stop. So, we choose a knight named Yves to defend the honor Francs. The gates of the city open, proudly perched on his horse, the champion comes to face the giant. The lance of the germain shatters the shield of the brave Yves and doesn’t care about his chest. The champion of Paris slips off his horse and collapses. Did the germans win the duel ? So, he rushes to finish his opponent. It is the consternation in the camp of the Parisians, we tremble, we already lamented but as the triumphant german rushes on his wounded prey, Yves opens his eyes. He moves and raises his spear sharply, the point sinks gently into the defect of the giant's armor, just in that space, under the belly where the leather joins the metal parts. The vanquished collapses in a great noise of wrinkled iron and the Parisians let their joys burst forth. A second is enough and they have, in a way, won the war. " </p>
