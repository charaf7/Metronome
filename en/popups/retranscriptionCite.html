    	<h2>The young craftsman who designed the locks and ironwork of the central portal of Notre-Dame by selling his soul to the devil.</h2>
        <p> (violin music)</p>
        <p>Lorant Deutsch : “This is the masterpiece, gigantic Notre-Dame de Paris. It takes 107 years to be look up by Parisian people, thinking that they use many employees and expertise, it is said that we offered to an young craftsman whose name is Biscornet..” </p>
        <p>(music of suspense)</p>
        <p>Lorant Deutsch : "... the execution of the locks and ironwork of the central gate. This unhoped-for command, a real honor, enthusiasm, what a benefit  to his reputation before feeling overwhelmed by an implacable reality: the modest dimensions of his forge. How to carry out your task and succeed in such an issue? Without supernatural help, it is impossible. Then Biscornet signs a pact with the Devil who promises to help him in time against his soul. Devil helped him so much that he had to use holy water to open the doors. But the work of the metal is amazing, it is incredibly subtle and even today, experts wonder about how we executed these amazing ironwork. Unfortunately, Biscornet, terrified, can’t be found and he dies shortly after the completion of his work. It is in the tomb that he carries his secret but he leaves us his splendid ironwork to admire. "</p>

    	<h2>The marriage of King Robert with his great cousin disapproved of all and the precautions of the servants who purify the dishes of the king.</h2>
         <p>(music)</p>
         <p>Lorant Deutsch : “In L’île de la Cité (the island of the city), King Robert, the second Franc king of the Capetian dynasty celebrates the year of 1000 in the isolation of a palace where is almost empty. The vassals, the counselors, the clerics, and even most of the servants fled. What curse has it fallen in its walls? How could the son of Hugues Capet whose life is exemplary be forsaken by all? Well, you know that King Robert fell in love with a married woman : the famous Berthe of Burgundy.</p>
        
        <p>The beautiful girl becomes a widow and the king can get her hand. But Hugues Capet is opposed because Berthe is none other than the great cousin of the King. At the death of his father Robert married his lover. But the church that doesn’t play with the bonds of consanguinity even if they are not far away and tortuous excommunicates the King of Franci of the community of the faithful. A conviction and a damnation.</p>
        <p>Thus the last domestic still on the spot take great precautions. They purify the king's dishes by fire and prayer after each use. Convinced that a simple contact with his utensils will devote them to the eternal flames of hell. In front of the constant reminder of their incestuous union true curse, Berthe cracks. In addition, she only gave the king for his descendants a stillborn child in five years of marriage, and the church, which does not accept to be upset, also proclaimed a seven-year penance in case of non-separation of husband. In the face of such pressures and misfortunes Berthe tells herself that, deep down, she does not really want to be queen of francs. She renounces love and leaves Paris. When to Robert his pious repentance is displayed with excessiveness.  He cries, laments, goes to Parisian churches every day. They sing louder than the others, spend nights in prayer and even go to bed by the mark of penance. He feeds the poor washing their feet. The king does everything to atone for his sins. But will that be enough to secure the salvation of his soul?”. </p>

    	<h2>The music of the good king Dagobert who put his pants (underwear) upside down is a revolutionary song that discredits kings and may denounce his relationship with his minister Eloi.</h2>
        <p>(rebuilding Dagobert’s death in his vault at Ile de la Cité in the seventh century)</p>
        <p>(religious music)</p>
        <p>Lorant Deutsch: "To mark his absolute power, Dagobert intends to inscribe his munificence in stone and what is better than a religious building. This obvious alliance of temporal and spiritual power can just be appreciated by a people more and more attached to the faith and strengthen their duty of obedience to their king. Dagobert thinks and has little rest. Paris has already its abbey, so it's towards Saint Denis that Dagobert casts an eye. "</p>
        <p>(3D modeling of Saint Denis Basilica)</p>
        <p>Lorant Deutsch: "Be careful to the seventh century, Saint Denis does not have at all the architectural aspect that we know today. At the time of Dagobert, she is much more modest. Dagobert is convinced that from heaven, Saint Denis keep an eye on him. He even appeared to him in a dream and the appearance grants him his protection provided that Dagobert offers to him the most sumptuous burial. The task is entrusted to Eloyes. Goldsmiths, ministers and religious advisers, they make a superb work of gold and precious stones. The balustrades are covered with gold, the silver doors and the marble roof. Unfortunately, Dagobert died a few years later at just 35 years old. "</p>
        <p>(interior and exterior of the basilica of Saint Denis)</p>
        <p>Lorant Deutsch: "In the thirteenth century, the monks of Saint Denis want to salute the King Dagobert, benefactor of the place but the sulfur reputation of the King makes them tremble. They imagine a sculpture a little ambiguous that reads in stone as a comic. The soul of the King is figured as a child naked and crowned and carried to hell by the claws of the demons. Fortunately Saint Denis, Saint Martin and Saint Maurice deliver this soul, present it to heaven and allow it to enter paradise. The message is clear, Dagobert would have deserved hell but the saint’s intercession miraculously opened the blessed eternity’s door. Nevertheless for eternity, Dagobert will remain the best King who put his pants upside down. Anachronism because the panties, kind of shorts a little puffing that stops at the knees, will be created by inspired designers only a thousand years later. </p>
        <p>But the revolution, which makes fun of the historical truth, has produced this refrain to mock kings and saints. Did public’s opinion want to make fun of a lazy or distracted King? Or in an awesome vision, did she want to play with the unnatural love affairs between Dagobert and his minister Eloyes, loves upside down like panties? Finally, as sublimity hastens to put it back on the spot, morality is safe. "</p>

    	<h2>The arrangement between a barber who killed some of his customers and gave the bodies to his pastry neighbor who used the flesh to garnish his fondues and pies to get rich.</h2>

        <p>Lorant Deustch : Ile de la cité’s district is full of memories. Some of them, reveals a strange and mysterious Paris. See Chanoinesse road with its beautiful houses of the sixteenth century where many chanoines was houses. Well, you know, there, two centuries ago, there were two neighboring houses, one occupied by a barber, the other by a pastry cook, honest business activity for honest neighbors. Even though, in this street, we shuddered with fright.</p>
        <p>(reconstruction of the Rue Chanoinesse in the 14th century where lived the barber and the pastry chef)</p>
        <p>Loran Deustch : On the chanoinesse road in the 4th district of Paris in 1387, it turned out an incredible business.</p>

        <p>(rebuilding : of the barber and pastry chef who take care of the body)</p>

        <p>(reconstitution of the pastry chef's bakery)</p>
        <p>Lorant Deutsch : “Celui-ci, d’une aussi piètre moralité que son confrère, lui proposa une association de bon voisinage : faire disparaître les corps des victimes en enrichissant leurs bourses.”</p>
        <p>(reconstitution de la boulangerie du pâtissier)</p>
        <p>A woman enters the bakery: "Hello" : Lorant Deutsch: "The recipe was simple, you just had to cook it. Once chopped, spicy and well-seasoned, the pastry chef garnished its delicacies and patés, which the inhabitants of the neighborhood tore out. Barber and baker blossom, our young foreign student was the last main ingredient of this macabre kitchen because his dog, with his distress not to see his master, shouted for three days at the door of the shop exciting the curiosity of residents. Convicted to the stake, two accomplices perished and their shops were razed with prohibition to build on these places for a long time. </p>

Then parisis incited by the victorious Romans, gather around this place of faith and devotion. Islands linked together by bridges, draws the outline of a new agglomeration. It will not be Lucotecia, Gauloise agglomeration, but Lutèce Gallo-Roman city. It slowly emerges from this language of lost land in the waters that will one day be the island of the city (île de la cité)."</p>
